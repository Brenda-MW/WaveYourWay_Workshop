# Wave Your Way: Deploy Personalized Gesture Recognition using ToF Sensors with MATLAB and STM32Cube.AI Dev Cloud

Just as speech and handwriting bear the unique signature of an individual, human gestures carry a distinct personal touch. Crafting a one-size-fits-all classifier for gesture recognition poses significant challenges due to the inherent variability among individuals. Accurately recognizing gestures in different scenarios, such as driving and gaming, under variable carry position of a tiny device, remains challenging due to limited and costly data availability.

In this hands-on workshop, we present an end to end approach that combines the power of MATLAB and ST machine learning development environments to address the challenges of data preprocessing, model selection and performance evaluation in a systematic, productive, and efficient workflow. Movement-based signal data captured by time-of-flight (ToF) sensors contain patterns specific to different gestures. Deep learning models are trained to automate feature extraction within a gesture dataset gathered from human volunteers. Participants will explore different architectures, layers, and compression techniques. We then introduce STM32Cube.AI Dev Cloud, a cutting-edge platform for deploying and optimizing deep learning models on micro-controllers (MCU). Participants will export the trained models from MATLAB to STM32Cube.AI Dev Cloud. They will gain insights into evaluating performance benchmarks against the stringent requirements of tiny devices.
